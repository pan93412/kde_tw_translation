"Blinken is based on an electronic game released in 1978, which challenges "
"players to remember sequences of increasing length. On the face of the "
"device, there are 4 different color buttons, each one with their own "
"distinctive sound. These buttons light up randomly, creating the sequence "
"that the player must then recall. If the player is successful in remembering "
"the sequence of lights in the correct order, they advance to the next stage, "
"where an identical sequence with one extra step is presented. If they are "
"incorrect, the game is lost, and the player must start again from the "
"beginning. The goal is to get a high score - each step in the sequence is "
"worth one point, so correct entry of a sequence of 8 lights is worth 8 "
"points on the high score table."

"Blinken 是基於一套 1978 年發行的遊戲而來。該遊戲可以挑戰玩家的記憶力，並不斷"
"增加長度與難度。一開始，有四個不同顏色的按鈕，每個鈕有自己不同的聲音。這些按"
"鈕會隨機亮起，產生一組讓玩家記憶的序列。如果玩家成功記住這樣的序列順序，則可"
"以進到下一關。若是失敗，則要從頭開始。得分越高越好。"
