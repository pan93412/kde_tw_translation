"KBlocks is the classic falling blocks game. The idea is to stack the falling "
"blocks to create horizontal lines without any gaps. When a line is completed "
"it is removed, and more space is available in the play area. When there is "
"not enough space for blocks to fall, the game is over."
msgstr "KBlocks 是類似俄羅斯方塊的遊戲。俄羅斯方塊的玩法還需要多做介紹嗎？"
